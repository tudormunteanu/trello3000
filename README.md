**Trello 3000**
===

What?
---
Trello 3000 contains a few enhancements on top of the already great Trello. 
If Trello is a foreign word to you, please take a look over [here](http://trello.com/).
Essentially, it's a very flexibe organising tool built by the pros from [FogCreek](http://www.fogcreek.com/).

Why?
---
I have buil Trello 3000 to fill a few gaps which Trello left (probably intentionally) open like:
card and list specific time estimates, spent time and stronger highlighting of cards. 
As I notice more needs and as time permits me, more features will come.

Spent time and estimates are actually abstract indicators of resources. These "units", can
represent any other resource. In Agile or Scrum methodologies, most of the times these
refer to hours. Depending on the scale, they could also mean number of sprints. 

How?

**Adding estimate units**

Estimate units represent how many units resources (hours, days, etc.) will be 
needed to solve a card. Add this value in the title of the card, between paranthesis.
